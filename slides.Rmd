# Learning Goals for this Week

* Define the term "field" experiment 
* Identify and explain the key features of field experiments
* Discuss how field experiments allow marketers to make causal claims about their marketing intervention 
* Compute descriptive statistics and visualize data from a field experiment 
* Use statistical hypothesis testing to analyze data from a field experiment to answer a strategic question of relevance to managers

* New burger to be **introduced to all** stores 
* **Three** different **promotion strategies** used (promo 1, 2 or 3)
* **Managers care about sales**
* No access to previous sales data

class: font150
# The Burger Promotion Problem

Access to information about store characteristics:

* Market size: Small / Medium / Large 
* Age of store: in years since opening 

You can track: 
* Weekly sales (in hundreds of thousands of dollars) per store
* For up to 4 weeks 

**Discussion Questions**:

**1. How would you allocate promotion strategies to stores?**

**2. How would you evaluate the effectiveness of each promotion strategy?**

# Potential Issues Encountered

<!---

* **Lurking Variables**: variable that is not included as an explanatory or response variable in the analysis but can affect the interpretation of relationships between variables.
  - Also called a confounding variable

<br>

* **Sample Selection Bias**:  Failing to ensure that the sample obtained is representative of the population intended to be analyzed

<br>

* **No Control Group**: Effectiveness compared to no intervention (eg. promotional strategy)

# Field Experiments 

> Field experimentation represents the conjunction of two methodological strategies: **experimentation** and **fieldwork**.

**Core idea of Experiments**:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/random_allocation.png"

```

.center[along with the observation/measurement of an outcome variable]

Remark: Experiments are often also called A/B tests or A/B/n tests in marketing and data science.

# Field Experiments 

<br>
Key features of a field experiment: 

<br>

1. Authenticity of treatments 
2. Representativeness of participants 
3. Real world context 
4. Relevant outcome measures

<br>

In most field experiments, participants are not even conscious that they are taking part in an experiment

# "True" Experiments 

<br>

Three identifiable aspects:

<br>

1. Comparison of outcomes between treatment and control 
2. Assignment of subjects is to groups is done through a randomization device
3. Manipulation of treatment is under control of a researcher / analyst


.font70[Dunning, T. (2012). Natural experiments in the social sciences: A design-based approach. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.]

When done correctly: **isolates the incremental effect** of the treatment on a outcome variable

class: font130
# Eight Steps of an Experiment

1. Write down a testable hypothesis.
  * Generally advocate a "no change" hypothesis
2. Decide on two or more treatments that might impact the outcome variable(s) of interest.
  * Generally, include a control treatment where nothing is changed to use as a baseline
3. Compute how many subjects to include in the experiment**.
3. Randomly divide subjects (people/stores) into groups.
  * Also need to decide on the sample size for each group.
4. Expose each group to a different treatment.
5. Measure the response in terms of an outcome variable(s) for subjects in each group.
  * Outcomes must be chosen in advance!
6. Compare responses via a (correct) statistical test.
7. Conclude whether to reject or "fail to reject" your hypothesis based on (7).


.font80[Remark: Good experiments have a hypothesis that answers a strategic question for a business]

# The Expedia Hotel Ranking Experiment

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="25%"}
url <- "figs/expedia.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Expedia ran an experiment where they compare consumer behaviour from the existing algorithm that ranks hotels for a given search to behaviour when the hotels were randomly ranked and displayed

* Expedia has provided a dataset that includes shopping and purchase data as well as information on price competitiveness. 

* The data are organised around a set of “search result impressions”,
  * i.e. the ordered list of hotels that a user sees after they search for a hotel on the Expedia website.

# Steps to Analyze Experimental Data 

<br>


1. Be explicit on the business question you are trying to answer 
2. Build an understanding of the data structure 
2. Compute some descriptive statistics 
3. Visualize the Data
4. Run (the correct) statistical test
5. Use the results to inform decision making

<!---
Things you might want to know: 

* How many observations in total? 
* How observations many per treatment?
* What is the mean/median number of sales per store in each treatment group?
* What is the standard deviation of the number of sales per store in each treatment group?
* Do observable characteristics of stores differ across treatments?

There
 are definitely more ...

# A Statistical Test

.center[
`r icons:::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid"), scale = 1)`
 **What is the "right" statistical analysis to run?**
]

1. Two-sample tests of means
  - Limit to binary comparisons
2. Two-sample test of proportions
  - We don't have proportions in our data
3. ANOVA
4. Linear Regression

# Comparing Proportions

Form null and alternative hypotheses:

* H0: $p_0 - p_1 = 0$
* HA: $p_0 - p_1 \neq 0$

Set a level of significance: $\alpha = 0.05$

Test Statistic: 

$$
z = \frac{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_0}{\sqrt{\frac{\bar{p}\bar{q}}{n_1} + \frac{\bar{p}\bar{q}}{n_2}  } } 
$$

# Comparing Means

`r icons:::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid"), scale = 1)`
 **Is click behaviour different between treatments?**

Click behaviour $\rightarrow$ number of clicks 

* .font70[Other ideas likely valid too]

Form null and alternative hypotheses:

* H0: $\mu_0 - \mu_1 = 0$
* HA: $\mu_0 - \mu_1 \neq 0$

Set a level of significance: $\alpha = 0.05$

Test Statistic (assuming unequal variances): 

$$\text{t-stat} = \frac{\hat{\mu}_1 - \hat{\mu}_2}{\sqrt{\left( \frac{\hat{\sigma_1}^2}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{\sigma_2}^2}{n_2} \right)}}$$

# Causal Interpretations and Experiments 

**Regression estimates from analysis of experiments have causal interpretations**

Why? 

* Counterfactual outcomes - compare to an alternative promotion
* "As good as random" assignment to treatments - lurking variables won't trouble us 
* No sample selection bias ... analyst picked the sample to match the group they care about
  
Regression estimates from experiments allow us to:

* Test whether treatments have effects 
  * Same as ANOVA or a t-test
* Estimate a magnitude of the effect sizes (and standard errors)
  * Which our t-test and ANOVA didn't

# Recap

* Well designed experiments deliver causal effects of marketing interventions
  - Eliminating "lurking variables" and sample selection bias

* 8 steps in the experimental method
* Analyzing data from an experiment involves descriptive statistics, data visualization and (statistical) hypothesis tests

# Tips on Presenting Findings

1. Know your audience 
2. Summarize the experiment 
3. Provide context
4. Lead with a recommendation
5. Support with analysis
6. Use graphs 
7. Check the (graph) labels!

# Most Experiments Fail

**Main Point of an experiment**:  test some idea 

* *not* proven something 

$\implies$ most experiments "fail"

* i.e. change does not lead to an improvement

**This is a good thing**

* Bad ideas fail quickly
* Investment is typically small ...
* ... as are the sample sizes

But failed experiments are not normally what one sees ...

* In publications, or 
* When talking to a firm
